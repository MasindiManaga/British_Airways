   - Visualized patterns in customer feedback.  
   - Identified factors affecting satisfaction.  

3. **Predictive Modeling**:  
   - Built models to predict buying behavior.  
   - Techniques used: LDA, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.  
   - Evaluated model performance using classificatiion report.
